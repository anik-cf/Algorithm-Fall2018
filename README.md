# Algorithm-Fall2018
Practice codes on Algorithm course that I am attending in SEU. 

##Assignment 1
Assignment 1 covers a simple project based on usage of Sorting Algorithm. The program use three input which refers to ItemId, Profit
and Weight. Based on each testcase input, the program calculates how much PPU each item can generate. Also, each item is sorted based on PPU. 
Implementation done on C++. The sorting algorithm used here is Bubble Sort.
